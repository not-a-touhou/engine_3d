# A fairly simple 3D renderer
There really is not much going on here...

A couple shapes, no varying height, not even mouse controls.

Entirely written because I thought it would be fun and found a *really* good video on the topic [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxMYroGay8c).

### What *can* it do then?

you can move around..?
that's about it.

yeah...

# How to "play"

Im your desired directory, enter:
```
git clone https://github.com/not-a-touhou/engine_3d

cd engine_3d

cargo run
```
### Controls
W, A, S, D to move
Left and right arrows to rotate camera
shift to move faster.

## Enjoy
